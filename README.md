### :pushpin:Things I still need to learn:
* **How to review** research from a **high-level perspective** (focusing on the **key points**)
* **How to organize and categorize** the reviewed research in clear tables
* **How to explain and organize** things in the **simplest way** possible
* **How to design** interesting **hypotheses** (before experimentation)
  * Ask people who see hypotheses from a completely new perspective and observe whether they find it interesting!
